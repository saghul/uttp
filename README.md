# uttp: a libuv based HTTP server

This is sample HTTP server using [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)
and [http-parser](https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser).

**NOTE**: I started this as a test for some things and it resulted in me
adding `uv_{udp,tcp}_init_ex` APIs to libuv, so it serverd its purpose.
It's published here with the hope that it's useful to someone.
